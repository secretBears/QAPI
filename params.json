{"name":"Qapi","tagline":"","body":"[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/secretBears/QAPI.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/secretBears/QAPI)\r\n\r\n\r\n# QAPI (Question API)\r\nQAPI is an API that provides location based computer-generated question/answer sets. The semantic web contains vast amounts of data that we wanted to transform into knowledge which can be used by developers for their next fancy quiz game. We also invented a cool buzzword for this concept: data driven games - go tell your friends.\r\n\r\n## Is it free\r\nYes it is. That is, it's free until everybody has been enslaved and can no longer live without QAPI. At that point we will change to a lucrative pay-per-request plan. ;)\r\n\r\nAwesome. How can I use it?\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nQAPI provides results based on a simple GET query to <code>/api/{longitude}/{latitude}</code>. So if you want questions for the center of the world, just call\r\n\r\n```\r\nget /api/0/0\r\n```\r\n\r\nEasy...\r\n\r\n### But will it JSON?\r\nQAPI returns it's result as a JSON object in the following format:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"id\":20,\r\n  \"question\":\"Frage 20\",\r\n  \"place\":\"Linz\",\r\n  \"answers\":[{\r\n     \"answer\":\"20 answer 1\",\r\n     \"is_true\":false\r\n   },{\r\n      \"answer\":\"20 answer 2\",\r\n      \"is_true\":true\r\n   },{\r\n      \"answer\":\"20 answer 3\",\r\n      \"is_true\":false\r\n   },{\r\n      \"answer\":\"20 answer 4\",\r\n      \"is_true\":false\r\n   }]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Public API\r\nThere will be a public API which can be used for your own application, without hosting your own QAPI. More information will be available soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\nThis awesome project is powered by secret bears.\r\n\r\n* Alex Junger\r\n* Thomas Mayrhofer ([webpapaya](http://www.twitter.com/webpapaya))\r\n* Stefan Laimer\r\n\r\nGive them a cookie.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
