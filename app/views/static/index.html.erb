%h3 What is QAPI?
%p:plain QAPI is an API that provides location based computer-generated question/answer sets. The semantic web
contains vast
amounts of data that we wanted to transform into knowledge that can be used by developers for their next quiz games.
We also invented a cool buzzword for this concept: data driven games - go tell your friends.

%h3 Is it free?
%p:plain Yes it is. That is, it's free until everybody has been enslaved and can no longer live without QAPI. At that
point we will change to a lucrative pay-per-request plan. ;)

%h3 Awesome. How can I use it?
%p:plain QAPI provides results based on a simple GET query to <code>/api/{longitude}/{latitude}</code>. So if you want
questions for the center of the world, query <code>/api/0/0</code>. Easy...

%h4 Will it JSON?
%p
:plain QAPI returns it's result as a JSON object in the following format: {"id":20,"question":"Frage 20","place":"Linz","answers":[{"answer":"20 answer 1","is_true":false},{"answer":"20 answer 2","is_true":true},{"answer":"20 answer 3","is_true":false},{"answer":"20 answer 4","is_true":false}]}

%p:plain The resulting JSON comprises of a question and three corresponding answers,
one of which is marked as true in the
is_true flag.
