# About

We are [Secret Bears](https://github.com/secretBears). Actually we are so secret that even our lector at the [University of Applied Sciences Salzburg](http://www.fh-salzburg.ac.at/)
doesn't know anything about us.

QAPI and all QAPI related side-projects were developed by:

* Alex Junger ([webnitrat](http://webnitr.at/))
* Stefan Laimer ([slaimer](http://twitter.com/stlaimer))
* Thomas Mayrhofer ([webpapaya](http://thomas.mayrhofer.at/))

QAPI is free to use until it gets really successful. Then we will change to a lucrative pay-per-request plan =).

This project was our multimedia project in our 4th semester of our studies at the university.
Check out the [portfolio](http://portfolio.mediacube.at/) to see other projects from our colleges.

Feel free to drop us a mail if you are interested in QAPI or some of our other projects.
